0.3.1: - added HCalpha to the options so that HCthresh can be used in
       	 get.biom with different alpha values

0.3.0: - all pls methods now use widekernelpls rather than kernelpls
       - more efficient HC calculations for the multivariate methods,
       	 in particular a more efficient p-value estimation
       - eliminated function studentt.fun since the original in the st
       	 package no longer has the verbose output
       - introduction of BMark object type and the coef, print and
       	 summary generic functions
       - simplification of get.biom function argument list by definition of
       	 biom.options function and .biom.options object, as in the pls
       	 package
       - default values for stability-based selection are now the ones
       	 used in the 2011 ACA paper, in particular the default for
       	 scaling now is "auto" and no longer "none"
       - renaming of all foo.biom functions to foo.stab
       - implementation of Higher Criticism

0.2.6: first version submitted to CRAN, and used in the 2011 ACA publication
